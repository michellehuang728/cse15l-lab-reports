In this lab report I will write the stuff we learnt in the past two weeks, which will be divided into three parts. 
In part 1, I will write a web server called StringServer. 
In part 2, I will show the process of debugging. 
In part 3, I will summarize and reflection on the new things that I learnt in the past two weeks.
